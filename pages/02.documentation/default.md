Currently the online documentation is in itâ€™s very early stages. As an OpSim team we try to document as much as possible, however coding comes at the first place now. If you are interested to help us out in this respect then please contact us on the [OpSim developers mailinglist](http://opsim-developers@lists.sourceforge.net).
